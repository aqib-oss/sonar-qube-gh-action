## Making a change

- Create a branch for your changes e.g. `git checkout -b fix/npe-get-salary`

### Submitting a PR

- Add your changes to git: `git add .`
- Install and run the pre-commit hooks:

  ```shell
  pre-commit install
  pre-commit run --all-files
  ```

  - The `pre-commit` hooks do NOT run on new files till they start to be tracked by `git`.

- Make a commit that follows the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) that works with the [Python Semantic Release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package used for generating releases for this Python project.

  ```shell
  <type>[optional scope]: <description>

  [optional body]

  [optional footer(s)]
  ```

  - e.g. `git commit -m "fix: NPE is get_salary method"`
  - Start a commit message with one of the following: `fix:` | `feat:` | `perf:` | `build:` | `ci:` | `refactor:` | `docs:` | `test:` | `chore:` | `style:`
  - By default, if you do not set the start as above, the update is considered a patch.
  - For a breaking change, add "BREAKING CHANGE" in the footer of the full commit message e.g.

  ```shell
  feat: A whole new way of doing things
  BREAKING CHANGE: The amazing option will now be replaced with the boring option.
  ```

- Make sure to get the latest changes from the `main` branch. Fix any conflicts if needed.

  ```shell
  git fetch origin
  git merge origin/main
  ```

- Push your branch upstream:
  - For the initial push: `git push --set-upstream origin docs/update-docs`
  - For subsequent pushes: `git push`
- Create a PR on GitHub with your branch.
